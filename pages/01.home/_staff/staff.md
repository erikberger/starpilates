    text: Amy began to fall in love with Pilates while at Goucher College in Baltimore, MD. At Goucher, she was awarded a Pilates Certification scholarship to enroll in the Romanaâ€™s Pilates Certification program in New York City in the Summer of 2003. In this program, she endured 650+ hours of training and five exams to receive her certification. Amy returned to Goucher to teach Pilates and eventually graduated with honors with a Bachelor of Arts in Dance in 2004. Amy moved to Philadelphia in the Fall of 2005 and after having taught at more than seven studios in four states she opened Star Pilates in March of 2008. Amy loves having her own Pilates studio and loves traveling all over the country for Pilates conventions and workshops. She has also continued her love of dance having taught Modern at Goucher and performing in the Garden State Dance Festival in 2006 and 2007 as well as being a former company member of SHARP Dance Company from 2007-2011. Lastly, Amy feels very lucky to have the best Pilates clients in Philadelphia!
